This is a flask APP which is a wrapper around the new OPENAI models. 
Here chatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) and gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 can be accessed through the interface. 
The main goal of the project is to train this models on own (Blueprint) datas \
and to access the answers for these trained models. 
For this particular flask wrapper, the answers are conveniently accessed straight trough the 
web page.

Have installed:
openai (+v.0.26)

pandas
numpy 

After cloning, at the main directory (which contains the app.py) simply run:
